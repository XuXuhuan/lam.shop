# lam.shop
this website was inspired by stake the educational gambling website, it is a shop where you can buy skins for your stakeless risk-free gambling TO TEACH STUDENTS ABOUT BINOMIAL DISTRIBUTION. it was built using js, html, css and some sql. a challenge i encountered was that i needed to integrate matter.js for the physics engine which i have not previously used. i feel accomplished with the design and how well integrated my work is and i learnt how to use matter.js quite in depth. i can improve on lam.shop by maybe making the design better and adding more functionality, as well as maybe some more EDUCATIONAL resources regarding binomial distribution.
